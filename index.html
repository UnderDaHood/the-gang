      Below: Our Story</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a group of shapes. They were mostly black and rectangular. They were mean and very serious.
    </p>
    <p>And so they kicked the 3 shapes that didn’t conform out of their gang, which was called the Right Angled Gang.</p>
    <p>And so these 3 shapes were very sad, but found great joy and comfort being around each other. They soon started having a lot of fun, started rocking and rolling, started being silly, and became the most well-known shape gang in the universe.</p>
    <p>They even started making fun of squares and rectangles in what they like to call ‘Square Offs’!</p>
